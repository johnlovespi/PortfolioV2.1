# NERP/PERN ReactJs Portfolio Template

### Technologies used:

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Framework used for our server
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Client side library for our view layer
- [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - Client side routing for our React client
- [WebpackV3](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) - Application bundler used for our React client

## Getting Started
**Install Node Modules with**
```
$ npm install
```

**Run Webpack build and tell webpack to continue to watch for changes**
```
$ npm run watch
```
-  The `watch` script (located in package.json under scripts) is used for development. It "watches" the `src/` directory
for any changes and rebuilds the React Client.

**Open another terminal window and start your server**
```
$ npm start
```
